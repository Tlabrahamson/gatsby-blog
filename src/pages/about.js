        <p>
          The name is Tim Abrahamson. I was exposed to coding in high school. I
          took a couple of Java programming courses and while I didn't fully
          grasp it, I enjoyed it. I was under the impression that you had to
          have a college degree to pursue a career in tech so my interest
          fizzled out.{" "}
          <span role="img" aria-label="This is an emoji that is shocked.">
            ðŸ˜¦
          </span>{" "}
          I didn't have the funds and wanted to avoid the debt of a college
          education.{" "}
          <span
            role="img"
            aria-label="This is an emoji that is down in the dumps."

        <h1>A New Hope</h1>
        <p>
          Fast forward through a nine year stretch in the fast food industry, my
          fiance encouraged me to pursue my dream! I started to learn web
          development through freecodecamp.org and my love was revived. I
          enrolled in a 19 week program on full stack web development at a local
          community college and began to learn even more. After receiving the
          certification, I landed a 3 month internship with Kinetic
          Communications in Birmingham, AL.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p>
          Once the three month period expired, I was able to get a handful of
          freelance gigs and now I am here! I am actively seeking a full time
          developer position.
        </p>

          I Am Ready!{" "}
